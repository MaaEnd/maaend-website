Built on MaaFramework’s “black-box automation” capabilities, it forms a closed loop of screenshot capture → visual recognition → branching decisions → action execution. Without reading any in-game/internal data, it hands repetitive tasks over to the program.",
    "paragraph2": "Whether you’re on PC or Android/emulators, MaaEnd runs tasks with the same logic to minimize platform-specific hassle. With auto-updates and continuous iteration, you can spend your time in the game—not in configuration.",
